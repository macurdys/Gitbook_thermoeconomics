# Learning Sequence

This is the recommended reading order for working through the foundations. Each entry lists what you should read before it.

## Level 1: Core Information Theory
*No prerequisites — start here*

1. **[Shannon (1948)](information-theory/shannon.md)** — What is information? Entropy as uncertainty.
2. **[Jaynes (1957)](information-theory/jaynes.md)** — Maximum entropy principle. The bridge between information and physics. *Prereq: Shannon*
3. **[Landauer (1961)](information-theory/landauer.md)** — Information erasure has physical cost. *Prereq: Shannon*
4. **[Bennett (1982)](information-theory/bennett.md)** — Computation can be reversible, but erasure cannot. *Prereq: Landauer*

## Level 2: Proof of Work Lineage
*Prereqs: Level 1*

5. **[Dwork & Naor (1993)](proof-of-work/dwork-naor.md)** — Proof of work as anti-spam.
6. **[Back (1997) — Hashcash](proof-of-work/hashcash.md)** — Practical PoW via partial hash collisions.
7. **[Finney (2004)](proof-of-work/finney.md)** — Making proofs transferable.
8. **[Nakamoto (2008)](proof-of-work/nakamoto.md)** — Bitcoin. Proof of work as consensus.

## Level 3: Deeper Frameworks
*Prereqs: Levels 1–2*

9. **[Wolfram Physics — Computational Irreducibility](wolfram-physics/computational-irreducibility.md)** — Why there's no shortcut.
10. **[Wolfram Physics — Causal Invariance](wolfram-physics/causal-invariance.md)** — Why independent observers converge.
11. **[Crutchfield — Computational Mechanics](computational-mechanics/crutchfield.md)** — Measuring computation in nature. *Prereq: Shannon*
12. **[Epsilon Machines](computational-mechanics/epsilon-machines.md)** — Minimal predictors. *Prereq: Crutchfield*

## Level 4: Self-Organization and Agency
*Prereqs: Levels 1–3*

13. **[Deacon — Incomplete Nature](terrence-deacon/incomplete-nature.md)** — Constraint as cause.
14. **[Deacon — Autogenic Theory](terrence-deacon/autogenic-theory.md)** — Self-creating systems.
15. **[Friston — Free Energy Principle](active-inference/free-energy-principle.md)** — Self-organization through surprise minimization.
16. **[Active Inference and Economic Systems](active-inference/economic-systems.md)** — Markets as inference.

## Level 5: Synthesis
*Prereqs: All above*

17. **[Proof of Work as Thermodynamic Process](proof-of-work/pow-thermodynamics.md)** — The nine-step argument.
18. **[The Thermoeconomic Operator](synthesis/thermoeconomic-operator.md)** — The formal framework.
19. **[From Big Bang to Blockchain](synthesis/from-big-bang.md)** — The full arc.

*You don't have to follow this order rigidly. But if something doesn't make sense, check whether you've covered the prerequisites.*
