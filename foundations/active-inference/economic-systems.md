## Overview

Active inference, when applied beyond neuroscience, provides a framework for understanding economic behavior: how agents form expectations, make decisions, allocate resources, and collectively maintain market structures.

In this framework, economic agents are not utility maximizers (the neoclassical assumption) but surprise minimizers — they act to confirm their models of the world, and they update those models when surprised.

## Economic Agents as Inference Engines

An economic agent under active inference:

1. **Maintains a generative model** of the economic environment (prices, demand, competitors, regulations)
2. **Generates predictions** about future states (expected returns, risks, opportunities)
3. **Acts** to make those predictions come true (investing, producing, trading)
4. **Updates** the model when outcomes diverge from expectations

This is richer than utility maximization because it naturally accounts for information-seeking behavior (exploration), model uncertainty (risk), and the role of shared expectations (institutions, conventions, protocols).

## Proof-of-Work Networks as Collective Active Inference

A blockchain network can be understood as a collective active inference system:

- **Individual miners** are active inference agents: they maintain models of profitability, adjust hash power, select transactions, and act (mine) to minimize surprise (maximize expected revenue)
- **The network** collectively maintains a shared generative model: the blockchain state. Consensus is the process by which individual agents converge on a single shared model
- **The difficulty adjustment** is a collective free energy minimization mechanism: it ensures the network's "predictions" (one block per target interval) remain accurate despite changes in total hash power
- **The price of the token** encodes the network's collective model of its own value — a self-referential generative model maintained by the thermodynamic work of mining

## Beyond Metaphor

This is not merely a useful way of talking about blockchains. Active inference makes quantitative predictions about agent behavior, network dynamics, and protocol design that can be tested and compared to empirical data.
