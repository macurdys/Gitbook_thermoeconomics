# Active Inference

Karl Friston's **Free Energy Principle** and its extension, **Active Inference**, provide a unifying framework for understanding how self-organizing systems — from cells to brains to economies — maintain themselves by minimizing surprise.

The relevance to thermoeconomics: proof-of-work networks can be understood as active inference systems that maintain a model of economic reality (the ledger) by continuously acting on the world (mining) to reduce uncertainty (achieving consensus).

## The Sections

**The Free Energy Principle** — Any system that persists must minimize variational free energy — a bound on surprise. This is a statement about what it means to exist as a bounded system in a changing environment.

**Active Inference and Economic Systems** — How the free energy principle applies to economic agents, markets, and protocols. Miners as active inference agents. The blockchain as a shared generative model.

**Markov Blankets and System Boundaries** — The mathematical structure that defines where a system ends and its environment begins. How Markov blankets appear in blockchain network architecture.
