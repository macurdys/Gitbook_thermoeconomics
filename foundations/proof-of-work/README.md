# Proof of Work

Proof of work is the engineering lineage of thermoeconomics — the tradition that built, step by step, the systems that instantiate the theoretical principles described in the other sections.

The idea: require a computational cost to perform an action (send a message, create a token, write to a ledger). The cost is verifiable but not forgeable. It is grounded in thermodynamics — in the physical irreversibility of computation.

## The Lineage

**Dwork & Naor (1993)** — The first proposal to use computational puzzles as a cost mechanism, originally to combat email spam. The foundational insight: make it expensive to send, cheap to verify.

**Back (1997)** — Hashcash: the first practical proof-of-work system. Partial hash collisions as postage stamps for email. Introduced the core mechanism that Bitcoin would later adopt.

**Finney (2004)** — Reusable Proofs of Work (RPOW): the first system to make proof-of-work tokens *transferable*. The missing bridge between computational puzzles and digital money.

**Nakamoto (2008)** — Bitcoin: proof of work as the consensus mechanism for a decentralized ledger. The synthesis of all prior work into a functioning monetary system. The difficulty adjustment as the thermodynamic governor.

**Proof of Work as Thermodynamic Process** — The theoretical synthesis: why proof of work works, why it must consume energy, and why that energy consumption is not waste but the physical foundation of value.
