# The Science

Thermoeconomics rests on a convergence of ideas from multiple fields. Each developed independently. Together they form a coherent picture: **economic value is grounded in physical law.**

This section organizes the foundational science into six traditions. Each one contributes a piece.

## Information Theory
*Shannon, Jaynes, Landauer, Bennett*

Information is physical. It takes energy to create, store, and erase. Shannon quantified it. Landauer proved it has thermodynamic cost. Bennett showed computation can be reversible but erasure cannot. Jaynes connected entropy in physics to entropy in inference. These results underpin everything that follows.

## Wolfram Physics
*Wolfram, Gorard, Wolfram Physics Project*

The universe may be a computation — a hypergraph rewriting system that generates space, time, and quantum mechanics from simple rules. Computational irreducibility means you cannot shortcut the computation; you must run it. Causal invariance means independent observers converge on the same causal structure. Both properties appear in proof-of-work consensus.

## Computational Mechanics
*Crutchfield, Shalizi, Young*

James Crutchfield's framework for the physics of information processing in natural systems. Epsilon machines are the minimal sufficient models of stochastic processes — the simplest representations that capture all predictive structure. This work provides rigorous tools for measuring the computational content of physical processes, directly relevant to understanding what mining actually computes.

## Terrence Deacon
*Incomplete Nature, Autogenic Theory*

Deacon asks: how do purpose, meaning, and value emerge in a universe governed by thermodynamics? His answer involves *constraints* — the things that are absent but do causal work. Autogenic systems maintain themselves by channeling thermodynamic dissipation through self-reinforcing constraint structures. This framework illuminates how proof-of-work networks create and sustain economic value through physical constraint.

## Active Inference
*Friston, Parr, Da Costa*

Karl Friston's free energy principle says that self-organizing systems persist by minimizing surprise — by building internal models that predict their sensory inputs. Active inference extends this to action: systems act on the world to confirm their predictions. Applied to economic systems, this framework explains how agents, markets, and protocols maintain themselves through ongoing computation against uncertainty.

## Proof of Work
*Dwork & Naor, Back, Finney, Nakamoto*

The engineering lineage. Proof of work began as an anti-spam mechanism (Dwork & Naor, 1993), became a practical system (Back's Hashcash, 1997), was made transferable (Finney's RPOW, 2004), and finally became the foundation of decentralized money (Nakamoto's Bitcoin, 2008). Each step made the thermodynamic nature of the system more explicit.

These traditions are not separate subjects being forced together. They are independent lines of inquiry that converge on the same conclusion: **computation is physical, information has cost, and value is grounded in entropy.**
