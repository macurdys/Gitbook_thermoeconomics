## The Concept

An **autogen** is the simplest possible system that generates and maintains the constraints that organize it. It is self-creating — not in the sense of appearing from nothing, but in the sense of producing the conditions for its own persistence.

Deacon's autogen is a thought experiment: imagine a system that combines:
1. **Autocatalysis** — a set of chemical reactions that catalyze each other, forming a self-amplifying cycle
2. **Self-assembly** — the products of autocatalysis spontaneously form a container (like a membrane) that keeps the catalysts together

Neither autocatalysis alone nor self-assembly alone is self-maintaining. But together, they form a reciprocal dependency: the container keeps the catalysts concentrated, and the catalysts produce the container. The system maintains itself *because* of its constraints, not despite them.

## Constraint as Cause

The central insight of autogenic theory: **constraints do causal work**.

In standard physics, causes are efficient — things push other things. But in self-maintaining systems, what matters is what is *prevented* from happening. The membrane prevents the catalysts from diffusing. The catalytic cycle prevents the system from reaching equilibrium. The difficulty adjustment prevents blocks from being produced too quickly.

These constraints are not external impositions — they are generated by the system itself and maintained because they enable the system's persistence. This is circular causation, but it is not paradoxical — it is the defining feature of living and purposive systems.

## Connection to Thermoeconomics

A proof-of-work blockchain is an autogenic system:

| Autogen Component | Blockchain Equivalent |
|---|---|
| Autocatalysis | Mining incentive loop: mining produces coins → coins have value → value incentivizes mining |
| Self-assembly (container) | Consensus rules: the protocol constrains what counts as a valid block, keeping the system coherent |
| Reciprocal constraint | Miners enforce rules that protect the value that pays them to enforce rules |
| Far-from-equilibrium maintenance | Continuous energy input from miners prevents the system from reaching "equilibrium" (chain halt) |

The economic value of proof-of-work tokens is a constraint-dependent property. It exists because of the thermodynamic constraints imposed by the mining process — and those constraints are maintained because the value incentivizes continued mining. This is autogenic organization at the level of a global economic system.
