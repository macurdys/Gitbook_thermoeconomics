# Incomplete Nature (2012)

> **Book:** Terrence W. Deacon, *Incomplete Nature: How Mind Emerged from Matter*, W.W. Norton & Company, 2012.

## Overview

*Incomplete Nature* tackles the "hard problem" of the natural sciences: how do phenomena like purpose, value, meaning, and consciousness emerge in a universe that appears to be governed entirely by efficient causation (billiard-ball physics)?

Deacon's answer: these phenomena are real but they are constituted by *absence* — by constraint, by what is *not* happening. They are "incomplete" in the sense that they cannot be fully described by listing what is present; they require reference to what is missing, what is potential, what is excluded.

## Key Concepts

**Ententional phenomena** — Deacon's term for anything that is defined by its relation to something absent: purpose (defined by a goal not yet achieved), meaning (defined by what a sign refers to), value (defined by what could be exchanged), function (defined by what a system is *for*). These are all real causal phenomena, but they cannot be reduced to present physical states.

**Three levels of emergent dynamics:**

1. **Homeodynamics** — thermodynamic processes: dissipation, equilibration, entropy increase. The baseline.
2. **Morphodynamics** — self-organization: pattern formation, symmetry breaking, far-from-equilibrium structures (convection cells, crystals, reaction-diffusion patterns). Order emerging from dissipation.
3. **Teleodynamics** — self-creating, self-maintaining systems that generate and preserve the constraints that organize them. These systems have *ends* — they persist *because* of their organization, not despite it.

## Connection to Thermoeconomics

A proof-of-work blockchain is a teleodynamic system in Deacon's framework:

- It is a far-from-equilibrium dissipative structure (miners consume energy continuously)
- It self-organizes through the difficulty adjustment (morphodynamic)
- It generates and maintains the constraints (consensus rules, economic incentives) that sustain its own existence (teleodynamic)
- Its *value* is an ententional property — defined not by what the tokens physically are (trivially: strings of bits) but by what they are *constrained to be* (scarce, transferable, unforgeable)

The economic value of Bitcoin is not contained in any physical state. It is constituted by the *constraints* that proof of work imposes — constraints grounded in thermodynamics. This is precisely Deacon's point: the most important features of living, purposive, value-laden systems are absential.
