# Terrence Deacon

Terrence Deacon's work addresses what may be the deepest question in thermoeconomics: **how do purpose, value, and meaning emerge in a universe governed by thermodynamics?**

His answer is radical and precise: these phenomena are constituted by *constraints* — by what is *absent* rather than what is present. Value is not a substance but a pattern of constraint that channels thermodynamic dissipation through self-maintaining structures.

This framework provides the philosophical and scientific foundations for understanding why proof-of-work systems create economic value — not by producing a useful output, but by instantiating a self-reinforcing constraint structure that persists because of its thermodynamic properties.

## The Sections

**Incomplete Nature (2012)** — Deacon's major work. How to explain the emergence of purpose, meaning, and consciousness from physics without invoking anything non-physical.

**Autogenic Theory and Constraint** — The theory of self-creating systems: how thermodynamic processes can generate and maintain the constraints that organize them, creating a circular causality that looks like — and *is* — purpose.

**Absential Features and Thermodynamic Work** — The concept of "ententional" phenomena: things defined by their relation to what is absent. Value, function, purpose, meaning — all are constituted by constraint, by what is *not* happening rather than what is.
