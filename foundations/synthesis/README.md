# Synthesis

This section is where the six foundational traditions converge into a unified framework.

The individual traditions — information theory, Wolfram physics, computational mechanics, Deacon's constraint theory, active inference, and proof of work — each contribute a piece. The synthesis shows how they fit together into a single coherent picture: **proof of work is the thermodynamic process by which physical energy becomes economic value.**
