# From Big Bang to Blockchain

> **Essay + Conversations:** Steph Macurdy, January 2026
>
> Two conversations tracing the full arc from cosmological entropy production through biological computation to blockchain consensus.

## Overview

How does the universe's thermodynamic arrow connect to the emergence of digital economic systems? These dialogues trace the thread from the Big Bang's low-entropy initial state through the emergence of structure, life, intelligence, and finally proof-of-work consensus as the latest expression of nature's tendency to produce complex, self-maintaining systems at entropy gradients.

## The Conversations

## Key Themes

- The second law as the engine of structure, not just disorder
- Energy gradients as the substrate for all complex systems
- Proof of work as a continuation of the same thermodynamic process that drives stellar nucleosynthesis, metabolism, and computation
- The Quai Network as a system designed with this understanding from the ground up
