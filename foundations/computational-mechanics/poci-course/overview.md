## The Argument

The Industrial Age produced thermodynamics — the physics of energy.

The Information Age has not yet produced its physics. We have Shannon's communication theory (1948), but that is engineering, not physics. We have Boltzmann's statistical mechanics, but that only connects information to energy at equilibrium.

The physics of information asks: **How does nature store and process information?**

Three observations drive the course:

1. **Information is not energy.** They are different accountings of the same physical systems. Related via S = kB ln 2 · H, but not interchangeable.

2. **Deterministic chaos means nature actively produces information.** A chaotic system generates genuine novelty at a measurable rate (its entropy rate hμ). Randomness is not noise from the outside — it is created from within.

3. **Nature actively produces structure.** Self-organization is ubiquitous. Patterns emerge spontaneously. Information is not just produced — it is _stored_.

The tension between these — how does nature balance order and randomness? — is the question computational mechanics answers.

## Course Logic

1. **Complex systems:** Order and chaos as dynamical phenomena
2. **Self-organization:** Emergence of chaos _and_ emergence of order
3. **Intrinsic computation:** How nature stores and processes information

The tools:
- **Dynamical systems theory** (256A) — the physics of processes
- **Information theory** (256A) — quantifying randomness and memory
- **Computational mechanics** (256B) — quantifying structure and computation

## The Central Thesis

> **Structure = Information + Computation**
>
> How nature is structured is how nature computes.

## "Between Order and Chaos" (Nature Physics 2012)

Crutchfield's review article summarizing the program:

The clock and the coin flip are mathematical ideals. Real processes live between them — partly predictable, partly random, always structured. Shannon gave us the tools to measure the randomness. Computational mechanics gives us the tools to measure the structure.

Van der Pol (1927) listened to deterministic chaos through a telephone earpiece — "an irregular noise... before the frequency jumps to the next lower value." He didn't know what he was hearing. Poincaré had analyzed the same phenomenon mathematically 30 years earlier.

Perception depends on preparation. When confronted by phenomena for which we are ill-prepared, we fail to see them. The tools of computational mechanics prepare us to see the structure hidden in apparent randomness.
