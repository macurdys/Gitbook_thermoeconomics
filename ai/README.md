# AI Instructor

This section turns any AI assistant into a thermoeconomics tutor.

---

## How It Works

Thermoeconomics sits at the intersection of six scientific traditions. No single student has all the prerequisites. An AI tutor with the full knowledge base can bridge any gap, for any student, in real time.

The AI doesn't replace the learning — it accelerates it by meeting you where you are.

## What's Here

| Resource | What It Does |
|---|---|
| [Instructor Prompt](INSTRUCTOR-PROMPT.md) | System prompt that turns an AI into a thermoeconomics tutor. Copy this into a new conversation. |
| [Concept Graph](concept-graph.md) | Dependency map: what must be understood before what. Give this to the AI so it can sequence your learning. |
| [Assessment Bank](assessment-bank.md) | Questions for testing understanding at every level. The AI uses these to check your progress. |
| [Key Equations](key-equations.md) | All the important math in one place. Reference sheet for both humans and AI. |

## Quick Start

1. Open a new conversation with Claude, ChatGPT, or any AI assistant
2. Paste the [Instructor Prompt](INSTRUCTOR-PROMPT.md) as the first message
3. Tell the AI your background (e.g., "I'm a Bitcoin miner" or "I have a physics PhD")
4. Let it guide you

## For Advanced Use

You can also give the AI specific pages from this GitBook:
- "Here's the page on Landauer's Principle — teach me this"
- "Here's the concept graph — what should I learn next after Shannon entropy?"
- "Here's the assessment bank — quiz me on information theory"
