# Absential Features and Thermodynamic Work

> **Key source:** Deacon, *Incomplete Nature*, Chapters 1–3

## The Concept

Deacon introduces the term **absential** to describe features of the world that are constituted by their relation to something that is *not* present. These include:

- **Function** — defined by what a system is *for* (an absent purpose)
- **Meaning** — defined by what a sign *refers to* (an absent referent)
- **Value** — defined by what could be *exchanged* (an absent alternative)
- **Purpose** — defined by what is *not yet achieved* (an absent goal)

These are not mystical properties. They are real, measurable, causally efficacious features of certain physical systems. But they cannot be located in any particular physical component — they exist in the *organization*, in the *constraints*, in the *pattern of what is excluded*.

## The Challenge

Science has traditionally struggled with absential features because the dominant explanatory framework — mechanism, efficient causation, reductionism — can only describe what *is*, not what *isn't*. Deacon argues this is why we lack a satisfactory science of value, meaning, and purpose: our explanatory tools are designed for a world of presence, and these phenomena are constituted by absence.

## Thermodynamic Work and Constraint

The connection to thermodynamics is through the concept of **work**. In physics, work is the result of constrained energy flow. Unconstrained energy dissipates — it increases entropy uniformly. But when energy flow is *constrained* (by a piston, by a membrane, by a hash function), the dissipation is channeled and can produce directed effects.

- A heat engine does work because it constrains thermal energy to flow through a specific path
- A living cell does work because it constrains chemical energy to flow through metabolic pathways
- A proof-of-work network does work because it constrains computational energy to flow through a specific hash function with a specific difficulty target

In each case, the *constraint* is what makes the energy dissipation useful — what gives it function, direction, and (in the economic case) value.

## Connection to Thermoeconomics

The value of a proof-of-work token is an absential feature in Deacon's sense:

- It is not contained in any physical property of the token (a bitcoin is just a number)
- It is constituted by constraint — by what the protocol *prevents* (double spending, inflation, forgery)
- It requires reference to what is absent — the energy already dissipated, the alternatives excluded, the future purchasing power anticipated

This is not a failure of explanation — it is the *correct* explanation. Value is not a substance to be found. It is a pattern of constraint to be maintained. And in proof-of-work systems, that constraint is grounded in thermodynamics.
