## Overview

The Wolfram Physics Project proposes a fundamental model of physics based on the progressive application of simple transformation rules to hypergraphs. From these rules, the structures we recognize as space, time, energy, and quantum mechanics emerge as large-scale features of the evolving hypergraph.

## The Core Idea

Start with a hypergraph — a generalization of a graph where edges can connect any number of nodes. Apply a simple rewriting rule: find a pattern, replace it with another pattern. Repeat.

From this process:
- **Space** emerges as the large-scale structure of the hypergraph
- **Time** emerges as the progressive application of rules (the causal graph)
- **General relativity** emerges from the curvature of the spatial hypergraph
- **Quantum mechanics** emerges from the branching of possible rule applications (the multiway system)

## Why This Matters for Thermoeconomics

The Wolfram model provides a framework in which computation, physics, and information are unified at the deepest level. Two properties of this framework appear directly in proof-of-work systems:

1. **Computational irreducibility** — There are no shortcuts. The system must be run to know its outcome. This is the same property that makes proof of work secure.

2. **Causal invariance** — Different orderings of rule applications produce the same causal structure. This is the same property that allows decentralized miners to converge on a single chain.

These are not metaphors. They are structural isomorphisms between the physics of the universe and the physics of consensus.
