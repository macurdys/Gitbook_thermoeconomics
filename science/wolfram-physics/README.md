# Wolfram Physics

Stephen Wolfram's Physics Project proposes that the universe is fundamentally a computation — a hypergraph rewriting system that generates the structures we observe as space, time, matter, and quantum mechanics from the repeated application of simple rules.

This framework has direct relevance to thermoeconomics because two of its core properties — **computational irreducibility** and **causal invariance** — appear as structural features of proof-of-work consensus systems.

## The Sections

**The Wolfram Physics Project** — Overview of the model: hypergraphs, rewriting rules, and how space, time, and quantum mechanics emerge from pure computation.

**Computational Irreducibility** — Why you cannot shortcut certain computations. The universe must "run itself" to determine its future states. Proof of work exploits the same property: there is no shortcut to finding a valid hash.

**Causal Invariance and Consensus** — Independent observers applying rules in different orders arrive at the same causal structure. This is structurally identical to how independent miners in a proof-of-work network converge on the same blockchain despite processing transactions in different orders.

**The Ruliad** — The entangled limit of all possible computations. The ultimate structure from which all possible rules, observers, and physical laws emerge. A conceptual framework for understanding why computation, physics, and mathematics are aspects of the same underlying reality.
