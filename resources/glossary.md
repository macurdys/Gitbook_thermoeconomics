# Glossary

Key terms used throughout this knowledge base.

**Active Inference** — A framework in which self-organizing systems maintain themselves by acting on the world to minimize surprise (variational free energy). Extends the Free Energy Principle to include action, not just perception.

**Autogen** — Terrence Deacon's minimal model of a self-creating system: a combination of autocatalysis and self-assembly that generates and maintains its own constraints.

**Causal Invariance** — The property of a system in which different orderings of operations produce the same causal structure. In Wolfram Physics, this gives rise to relativistic invariance. In blockchain, it underlies consensus.

**Computational Irreducibility** — The property that a computation's outcome cannot be predicted by any shortcut faster than running the computation itself. The foundation of proof-of-work security.

**Difficulty Adjustment** — The mechanism by which a proof-of-work protocol adjusts the computational cost of block production to maintain a target rate, regardless of changes in total hash power.

**Entropy** — In information theory (Shannon): the average information content of a message source, in bits. In thermodynamics (Boltzmann-Gibbs): a measure of the number of microscopic states consistent with a macroscopic description. Jaynes showed these are the same quantity.

**Epsilon Machine** — The minimal, unique, optimal predictor of a stochastic process (Crutchfield). Captures all the structure in a system's behavior and nothing more.

**eUTXO** — Extended UTXO. Cardano's extension of the UTXO model that adds datum and redeemer fields, enabling on-chain smart contracts.

**Free Energy Principle** — Karl Friston's principle that any self-organizing system that persists must minimize variational free energy — an upper bound on surprise.

**Hashcash** — Adam Back's proof-of-work system (1997) based on partial hash collisions. The direct ancestor of Bitcoin's mining algorithm.

**Landauer's Principle** — The minimum energy required to erase one bit of information is *kT* ln 2. Information erasure is thermodynamically irreversible.

**Markov Blanket** — The minimal set of variables that makes a system statistically independent of its environment. Defines the boundary of a system in the active inference framework.

**Maximum Entropy Principle** — When making inferences under incomplete information, assign the probability distribution that maximizes entropy subject to known constraints (Jaynes).

**Proof of Work (PoW)** — A consensus mechanism requiring participants to demonstrate computational expenditure. The thermodynamic cost makes the proof unforgeable.

**Ruliad** — The entangled limit of all possible computations (Wolfram). The ultimate abstract structure from which all possible physical laws, observers, and mathematical truths emerge.

**Statistical Complexity** — The Shannon entropy of the causal state distribution in a system's epsilon machine (Crutchfield). Measures the memory a system uses — distinct from entropy, which measures randomness.

**Teleodynamics** — Deacon's term for self-creating, self-maintaining dynamics that generate and preserve the constraints organizing them. The highest level of emergent organization.

**UTXO** — Unspent Transaction Output. The data structure used by Bitcoin and related blockchains to track ownership. Each UTXO is a discrete "coin" that can be consumed exactly once.
