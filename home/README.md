# Welcome

**Computational Thermoeconomics** is the science of how physical law grounds economic value.

This knowledge base is both a learning resource and a research archive. It is designed for two audiences:

**Human learners** — Whether you come from physics, computer science, economics, or cryptocurrency, there is a structured path through this material for you. Start with [How to Use This Resource](how-to-use.md) to find your path.

**AI tutors** — This knowledge base includes an [AI Instructor](../ai/README.md) layer: structured prompts, concept dependencies, assessment questions, and teaching sequences. Give these materials to an AI assistant and it becomes a thermoeconomics tutor that meets you where you are.
