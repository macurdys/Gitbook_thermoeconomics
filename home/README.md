# Welcome to Thermoeconomics

This knowledge base is the open companion to [thermoeconomics.info](https://thermoeconomics.info). It is a living document — a place to collect, organize, and build on the ideas that connect thermodynamics, information theory, computation, and economic value.

## Who This Is For

- **Researchers** exploring the physics of economic systems
- **Developers** building on proof-of-work and UTXO blockchain architectures
- **Students** of the Wolfram Blockchain Labs curriculum
- **Anyone** curious about why energy and computation matter for money

## How This Is Organized

The knowledge base has four main sections:

1. **The Science** — Foundational papers and frameworks, organized by intellectual tradition. Start here if you want to understand *why* thermoeconomics exists.

2. **UTXO Blockchain Architectures** — A visual and technical guide to the design space of UTXO-based blockchains. Start here if you want to understand *how* these systems work.

3. **The Course** — A structured curriculum covering blockchain fundamentals, programming, cryptography, and architecture. Dual-language: Wolfram Language and Python.

4. **Resources** — Papers, videos, tools, a glossary, and articles for further exploration.
