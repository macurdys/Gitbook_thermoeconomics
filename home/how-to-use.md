# How to Use This Resource

## Reading Paths

There is no single correct order. Choose based on your interest:

**"I want to understand the physics"** → Start with [The Science](../science/README.md), beginning with Information Theory, then Wolfram Physics, then Proof of Work.

**"I want to understand the blockchains"** → Start with [UTXO Architectures](../utxo-architectures/README.md) for a visual tour, then the [Course](../course/README.md) for deeper technical understanding.

**"I want to code"** → Go directly to [Module 2: Blockchain Programming](../course/module-2/README.md). Code examples are provided in both Wolfram Language and Python.

**"I want the papers"** → See [Key Papers & References](../resources/papers.md) for the complete reading list.

## Dual Language: Wolfram + Python

Throughout the course modules, code examples appear in two languages:

- **Wolfram Language** — The primary language of the original curriculum. Uniquely expressive for computational and mathematical concepts. Runs in Wolfram Cloud or Mathematica.
- **Python** — The open-source parallel track. Runs anywhere. Uses standard libraries like `web3.py`, `hashlib`, `cryptography`, and `matplotlib`.

You can follow either track or both. The concepts are the same; only the syntax differs.

## Videos

Video content from the Wolfram Blockchain Labs YouTube channel is linked throughout. The full library is in [Resources → Video Library](../resources/videos.md).
