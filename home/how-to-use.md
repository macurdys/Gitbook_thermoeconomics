## Learning Paths

There is no single correct order. Choose based on where you're coming from:

---

### Path A: "I'm a Bitcoin miner / crypto-native — I want to understand the physics"
**~4 weeks · Start with what you know, build the physics underneath it**

1. [Proof of Work](../foundations/proof-of-work/README.md) — You know this intuitively. Now see the formal lineage.
2. [Information Theory](../foundations/information-theory/README.md) — Shannon → Jaynes → Landauer. This is where the physics enters.
3. [PoW as Thermodynamic Process](../foundations/proof-of-work/pow-thermodynamics.md) — The synthesis. This is the "aha."
4. [The Thermoeconomic Operator](../foundations/synthesis/thermoeconomic-operator.md) — The formal framework.
5. [Quai Network](../quai/README.md) — The system that takes the thesis furthest.

### Path B: "I'm a physics / math student curious about blockchain"
**~3 weeks · You have the theory. Now see its economic expression.**

1. [Information Theory](../foundations/information-theory/README.md) — Quick review. Focus on Jaynes and Landauer.
2. [Computational Mechanics](../foundations/computational-mechanics/README.md) — Crutchfield's framework. If you like this, dive into the [POCI Course](../foundations/computational-mechanics/poci-course/README.md).
3. [Course Module 1](../course/module-1/README.md) — Blockchain fundamentals, fast.
4. [PoW as Thermodynamic Process](../foundations/proof-of-work/pow-thermodynamics.md) — Where your physics meets their money.
5. [The Thermoeconomic Operator](../foundations/synthesis/thermoeconomic-operator.md) — The formal result.

### Path C: "I want to code this"
**~6 weeks · Theory + hands-on implementation**

1. [Course Modules 1–5](../course/README.md) — The full blockchain literacy curriculum.
2. [Code Examples](../resources/code-examples/README.md) — Wolfram Language and Python implementations.
3. [Information Theory](../foundations/information-theory/README.md) — The math you need.
4. [Module 6: Thermoeconomics](../course/module-6/README.md) — The capstone.

### Path D: "I want to teach this to an AI and learn from it"
**Start here · Let AI meet you where you are**

1. Read [For AI Tutors](for-ai-tutors.md) — How this works.
2. Give the AI the [Instructor Prompt](../ai/INSTRUCTOR-PROMPT.md) and tell it your background.
3. Let it assess what you know and build a custom sequence for you.
4. Use the [Concept Graph](../ai/concept-graph.md) to see dependencies.
5. Test yourself with the [Assessment Bank](../ai/assessment-bank.md).

## Dual Language: Wolfram + Python

Throughout the course modules, code examples appear in two languages:

- **Wolfram Language** — The primary language of the original curriculum. Uniquely expressive for computational and mathematical concepts. Runs in Wolfram Cloud or Mathematica.
- **Python** — The open-source parallel track. Runs anywhere. Uses standard libraries like `web3.py`, `hashlib`, `cryptography`, and `matplotlib`.

You can follow either track or both. The concepts are the same; only the syntax differs.
