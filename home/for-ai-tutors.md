# For AI Tutors

This knowledge base is designed to be given to AI assistants (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.) so they can teach thermoeconomics interactively.

## How It Works

1. **Copy the [Instructor Prompt](../ai/INSTRUCTOR-PROMPT.md)** into a new conversation with your AI assistant.
2. **Tell the AI your background** — are you a miner, a physicist, a developer, a student?
3. **The AI will assess what you know** and guide you through the material in the right order.
4. **Ask it questions.** Point it at specific pages. Ask it to quiz you. Ask it to explain things differently.

## What the AI Has Access To

The [AI Instructor](../ai/README.md) section contains:

- **Instructor Prompt** — A system prompt that turns any AI into a thermoeconomics tutor
- **Concept Graph** — A dependency map showing what must be understood before what
- **Assessment Bank** — Questions for testing understanding at every level
- **Key Equations** — All the important math in one place

## Why This Works

Thermoeconomics sits at the intersection of six scientific traditions. No single student has all the prerequisites. An AI tutor with the full knowledge base can bridge any gap, for any student, in real time.

The AI doesn't replace the learning — it accelerates it by meeting you where you are and guiding you through a dependency graph that would take years to navigate alone.

## Tips

- Give the AI specific pages from this GitBook when you want it to teach from them
- Ask "what should I understand before this?" — the concept graph will help it answer
- Ask it to generate practice problems based on the assessment bank
- If an explanation isn't clicking, ask the AI to try a different tradition's framing (e.g., if Jaynes is too abstract, try Landauer's physical argument instead)
