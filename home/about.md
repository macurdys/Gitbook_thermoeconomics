# About the Author

**Steph Macurdy** is a researcher and educator working at the intersection of thermodynamics, computation, and blockchain technology.

As Head of Research to **Wolfram Blockchain Labs** and a contributor for the **UTXO Alliance**, Steph bridges the gap between computational science and the blockchain engineering — translating deep theoretical concepts into accessible educational content.

His work focuses on the thesis that proof-of-work systems are expressions of fundamental physical law that the economic properties of digital currencies inherit directly from thermodynamic constraints on computation.
