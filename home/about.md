# About the Author

**Steph Macurdy** is a researcher and educator working at the intersection of thermodynamics, computation, and blockchain technology.

As Content Manager for the **UTXO Alliance** and a contributor to **Wolfram Blockchain Labs**, Steph bridges the gap between computational science and the blockchain development community — translating deep theoretical concepts into accessible educational content.

Her work focuses on the thesis that proof-of-work systems are not merely engineering artifacts but expressions of fundamental physical law — that the economic properties of digital currencies emerge directly from thermodynamic constraints on computation.
