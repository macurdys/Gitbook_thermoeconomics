# About the Author

**Steph Macurdy** is a researcher at **Wolfram Research** working at the intersection of thermodynamics, computation, and blockchain technology.

As a researcher at Wolfram and contributor to **Wolfram Blockchain Labs**, Steph bridges the gap between computational science and blockchain engineering — translating deep theoretical concepts into accessible educational content and formal mathematical frameworks.

Her work focuses on the thesis that proof-of-work systems are expressions of fundamental physical law — that the economic properties of digital currencies inherit directly from thermodynamic constraints on computation.
