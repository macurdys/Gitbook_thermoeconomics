## About

The UTXO Alliance is a collaborative initiative of blockchain projects that share the UTXO transaction model. Its mission is to advance UTXO-based technologies through shared research, education, and interoperability.

## Members

The Alliance includes: Bitcoin, Cardano (IOHK), Ergo, Nervos Network, Alephium, Quai Network, DigiByte, Hathor Network, Wolfram Blockchain Labs, University of Zurich Blockchain Center, and others.

## The Handbook

The *UTXO Model Flavors Menu* is the Alliance's visual guide to the diversity of UTXO implementations. Through colorful flowcharts and accessible explanations, it takes readers from Bitcoin's "vanilla" UTXO to the exotic flavors offered by modern UTXO-based chains.

The architecture diagrams throughout this section are adapted from the handbook. The full PDF is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/UTXO-Alliance/handbooks).

## Wolfram Blockchain Labs' Role

Wolfram Blockchain Labs contributes computational intelligence to the UTXO ecosystem — developing educational materials, analytical tools, and the theoretical framework connecting UTXO architectures to the broader science of thermoeconomics.
