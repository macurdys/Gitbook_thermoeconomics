# Quai University Calls

A complete archive of the **Quai University Call** lecture series hosted by Quai Network co-founder **Dr. K** (Karl Kreder). These calls are among the clearest available explanations of Proof-of-Entropy-Minima (PoEM), energy-based money, and the thermodynamic foundations of Quai's architecture — making them essential viewing for thermoeconomic research.

Each session is a live technical lecture from the Quai Discord, progressively building from first principles of cryptocurrency to advanced concepts like intrinsic value tokens and mined transactions.

## Call #1 — Introduction to Cryptocurrency vs. Fiat

**February 6, 2023**

Quai 101: Dr. K explains the structural differences between the fiat monetary system and cryptocurrency, laying out the problems in the existing crypto space that Quai is designed to address. This is the foundational entry point — why blockchains are important and how Quai takes a revolutionary approach to scaling and security.

## Call #2 — Introduction to Multithreaded Execution

**March 10, 2023**

Dr. K takes a more advanced look at what sets Quai Network apart from other blockchains, introducing the concept of multithreaded execution — how Quai processes transactions in parallel across multiple chains simultaneously, analogous to multithreaded CPUs.

## Call #3 — Security & Interoperability in Disparate Scaling Topologies

**March 22, 2023**

With Ethereum adoption driving demand for scaling solutions, existing approaches (optimism, zk-snarks, rollups) introduce non-obvious security and interoperability challenges. Dr. K highlights these challenges and proposes a novel mechanism for creating trustless composable bridges in a multi-blockchain environment.

## Call #4 — An Introduction to Proof-of-Entropy-Minima

**April 10, 2023**

The pivotal lecture. Dr. K explains Proof-of-Entropy-Minima (PoEM) — Quai's consensus mechanism that reframes block selection from measuring arbitrary "work" to measuring **entropy reduction**. PoEM eliminates all consensus-based forks, enabling all nodes to remain in perpetual consensus by running a single mathematical formula.

## Call #5 — PoEM and Perpetual Consensus

**April 26, 2023**

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxQotH3lB7I&list=PLSGKRp6O6\_8M1S2kjk9OS22kTpGN0RwUr&index=5" %}

Dr. K goes deeper into how PoEM enables **perpetual consensus** among Quai nodes — the property that there is never a period of uncertainty or fork resolution. Because PoEM is causally invariant, it allows asynchronous coordination of an infinitely growing number of chains.

## Call #6 — New Technologies Used in Quai

**May 5, 2023**

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxQotH3lB7I&list=PLSGKRp6O6\_8M1S2kjk9OS22kTpGN0RwUr&index=6" %}

A survey of the full technical stack: Dr. K walks through the novel technologies implemented in Quai Network, including merged mining across multiple algorithms, the hierarchical chain structure, workshares, and the dual-token (Quai/Qi) architecture.

---

## Call #7 — Subnets in Quai Network

**May 17, 2023**

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxQotH3lB7I&list=PLSGKRp6O6\_8M1S2kjk9OS22kTpGN0RwUr&index=7" %}

Dr. K dives into **subnets** — what they are in the context of Quai's hierarchical structure, how they function as execution shards, and how they are used to achieve infinite scalability without sacrificing decentralization or security.

---

## Call #8 — Sharding in Quai Network

**June 6, 2023**

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxQotH3lB7I&list=PLSGKRp6O6\_8M1S2kjk9OS22kTpGN0RwUr&index=8" %}

Dr. K explains what kind of **sharding** Quai uses to achieve infinite scale. Unlike traditional database sharding or existing blockchain sharding approaches, Quai's merged-mined sharding maintains security across all shards via coincident blocks — bridging chains through Proof-of-Work rather than trusted validators.

## Call #9 — Eliminating MEV with Mined Transactions

**June 16, 2023**

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxQotH3lB7I&list=PLSGKRp6O6\_8M1S2kjk9OS22kTpGN0RwUr&index=9" %}

The first public introduction to **mined transactions** — Dr. K explains how this mechanism reduces the impact of Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) in Quai. By requiring computational work to submit certain transactions, the system removes the free-option that enables most MEV strategies.

---

## Call #10 — Proof-of-Work vs. Proof-of-Stake

**July 31, 2023**

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxQotH3lB7I&list=PLSGKRp6O6\_8M1S2kjk9OS22kTpGN0RwUr&index=10" %}

Dr. K makes the thermodynamic case for why Quai uses a **work-based consensus mechanism** rather than Proof-of-Stake. PoW is objective and physically grounded — each block represents a measurable, irreversible expenditure of energy. PoS relies on social consensus, introducing subjectivity and centralization risk.

---

## Call #11 — Intrinsic Value Tokens

**October 16, 2023**

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxQotH3lB7I&list=PLSGKRp6O6\_8M1S2kjk9OS22kTpGN0RwUr&index=11" %}

Dr. K introduces **Intrinsic Value Tokens (IVTs)** — tokens derived from real-world assets in a fully decentralized manner. This lecture connects directly to the Qi token's design as an energy-pegged currency: a token whose value is anchored to the thermodynamic cost of mining rather than speculative demand.

---

## Call #12 — Mined Transactions: Using PoW to Eliminate MEV

**December 8, 2023**

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxQotH3lB7I&list=PLSGKRp6O6\_8M1S2kjk9OS22kTpGN0RwUr&index=12" %}

A deeper technical treatment of **mined transactions**, expanding on Call #9. Dr. K explains precisely how Proof-of-Work is used to structurally eliminate MEV — not merely reduce it — making Quai's transaction environment fundamentally fairer and more resistant to front-running and sandwich attacks.

## Why These Calls Matter for Thermoeconomics

The Quai University series is one of the only public lecture archives that explicitly bridges **thermodynamics**, **information theory**, and **monetary systems** in a live technical format. Key themes across the series:

- **Entropy as the basis of consensus** — PoEM operationalizes entropy minimization as the selection criterion for block ordering, directly instantiating principles from E.T. Jaynes and statistical mechanics.
- **Energy-anchored money** — The Qi token is pegged to the thermodynamic cost of hash production, realizing the vision of thermodynamically grounded monetary units.
- **Intrinsic value from physical work** — IVTs represent a framework for deriving token value from irreversible physical processes rather than social agreement.
- **Causal invariance** — PoEM achieves the causal invariance property discussed in Wolfram Physics, where all observers agree on the causal order of events regardless of observation path.

These lectures should be read alongside the [PoEM whitepaper](../science/proof-of-work/pow-thermodynamics.md) and the [Causal Invariance and Consensus](../science/wolfram-physics/causal-invariance.md) section of this resource.
