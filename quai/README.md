# Quai Network

Quai Network is the proof-of-work blockchain that most fully embodies the thermoeconomic thesis. It was designed from the ground up with the understanding that proof of work is a thermodynamic process — and its architecture reflects that understanding at every level.

## Why Quai Matters for Thermoeconomics

Most proof-of-work systems treat mining as a necessary evil — a costly mechanism for achieving consensus. Quai treats it as the **foundation of economic value itself.**

Three features make Quai unique:

1. **Proof of Entropy Minima (PoEM)** — A consensus mechanism that extracts maximum information from every hash computation, rather than discarding surplus work above the difficulty threshold.

2. **Dual Currency (Qi + Quai)** — Two tokens representing two sides of the energy/value relationship. Qi is proportional to hash rate (energy). Quai is supply-constrained (scarcity). Together they create a complete energy-based monetary system.

3. **Hierarchical Architecture** — A three-level chain structure (Prime → Region → Zone) that scales throughput through merged mining, preserving the thermodynamic security of the whole system.
