# Thermoeconomics

**Where physics meets money.**

Thermoeconomics is the emerging science connecting energy, entropy, information, and computation to the foundations of economic value. It draws on deep traditions in physics and mathematics — from Shannon's information theory to Wolfram's computational universe — and finds their practical expression in proof-of-work blockchain systems.

This is an open knowledge base. It collects the science, the history, the code, and the ideas that make up this new field.

## What You'll Find Here

**The Science** — The foundational papers and frameworks: information theory (Shannon, Jaynes, Landauer), Wolfram Physics, Crutchfield's computational mechanics, Deacon's constraint-based causation, Friston's active inference, and the proof-of-work lineage from Dwork & Naor through Nakamoto.

**UTXO Blockchain Architectures** — A visual and technical guide to how UTXO-based blockchains work, from Bitcoin's original design through Cardano's eUTXO, Nervos' Cell model, and Quai Network's hierarchical architecture. Adapted from the UTXO Alliance Handbook.

**The Course** — A structured blockchain literacy curriculum originally developed at Wolfram Blockchain Labs. Dual-language: Wolfram Language (primary) with Python equivalents.

**Resources** — Papers, videos, tools, glossary, and articles.

## The Central Thesis

Proof of work is not waste — it is the thermodynamic bridge between physical reality and digital value. Every hash computed is entropy produced, energy dissipated, and information created. The economic properties of proof-of-work currencies (scarcity, unforgeable costliness, objective measurability) are direct consequences of the second law of thermodynamics.

This is not a metaphor. It is physics.
