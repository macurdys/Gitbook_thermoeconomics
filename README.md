# Computational Thermoeconomics

**Where physics meets money.**

Thermoeconomics is the emerging science connecting energy, entropy, information, and computation to the foundations of economic value. It draws on deep traditions in physics and mathematics — from Shannon's information theory to Wolfram's computational universe — and finds their practical expression in proof-of-work blockchain systems.

This is an open knowledge base. It collects the science, the history, the code, and the ideas that make up this new field.

## What You'll Find Here

**The Foundations** — The scientific traditions that converge on thermoeconomics: information theory (Shannon, Jaynes, Landauer), Wolfram Physics, Crutchfield's computational mechanics, Deacon's constraint-based causation, Friston's active inference, and the proof-of-work lineage from Dwork & Naor through Nakamoto.

**The Course** — A structured blockchain literacy curriculum originally developed at Wolfram Blockchain Labs, culminating in a thermoeconomics capstone. Dual-language: Wolfram Language (primary) with Python equivalents.

**Quai Network** — A deep dive into the system that most fully embodies the thermoeconomic thesis: Proof-of-Entropy-Minima consensus, dual-token architecture, and energy-based money.

**Research** — Original papers, reports, and essays advancing the field.

**Resources** — Papers, videos, tools, glossary, code examples, and transcripts.

**AI Instructor** — A structured knowledge layer that lets you give this material to an AI and have it teach you interactively.

## The Central Thesis

Proof of work is irreversible computation. A SHA-256 hash maps many inputs to one output, erasing information in the process. By Landauer's principle, each bit erased dissipates at least kBT ln 2 of energy as heat. This is not an engineering limitation — it is a consequence of the second law of thermodynamics.

The difficulty adjustment forces miners to perform this irreversible operation roughly 2^d times to produce one valid block. The result is a one-way function from energy to structured information: easy to verify, impossible to fake, and physically irreversible. You cannot un-dissipate the heat. You cannot reconstruct the discarded nonces. The work leaves a thermodynamic trace that cannot be counterfeited.

This is what gives proof-of-work money its economic properties. Unforgeable costliness follows from thermodynamic irreversibility — producing a valid block requires energy dissipation that cannot be reversed or simulated. Objective measurability follows from computational irreducibility — there is no shortcut to finding a valid hash; the only proof you did the work is the work itself. Scarcity is a protocol parameter (the emission schedule), but its credibility rests on the thermodynamic cost of block production — you cannot inflate the supply without doing the corresponding physical work.

The actual energy cost of mining is orders of magnitude above the Landauer limit. But the limit matters because it establishes that the cost is fundamental, not incidental. No future engineering improvement eliminates it. Any system that creates structured information through irreversible computation pays a thermodynamic price. Proof of work is the first economic system that treats this price as the basis of value.
