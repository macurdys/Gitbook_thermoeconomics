## Abstract

Can Active Inference or thermodynamics offer insight into the relationship between Qi and Quai? This report investigates the Quai Network's dual currency system through the lens of energy, entropy, and free energy — mapping the protocol's control mechanism, analyzing miner incentives, and building a conceptual bridge between cryptocurrency economics and the Free Energy Principle.

## Key Findings

**Protocol Analysis** — The kQuai controller balances demand by increasing kQuai when miners prefer Qi and decreasing it when they prefer Quai. Distilled to kQuai(i) = kQuai(i−1)[1 ± r].

**Economics of Maintenance** — Bitcoin's mining cost to market cap ratio (~1% annually) reveals undervaluation signals — a metric extensible to dual currency systems.

**Thermodynamic Bridge** — Qi maps to belief in the system (energy); Quai maps to belief in belief in the system (entropy). The equation is interpreted as a dialogue between P(x,y) and Q(x).
