## Abstract

All Proof-of-Work protocols anchor to the same physical phenomenon: repeated hash-based Bernoulli trials whose outcomes are IID. This paper connects the IID process to the Maximum Entropy Principle (Jaynes, 1957) and to the Generalized Boltzmann Distribution — the only distribution where Gibbs-Shannon entropy equals thermodynamic entropy. The blockchain is treated not as a ledger, but as a Thermoeconomic Operator: a system that converts physical work into informational order.

## Key Results

**Information as Rank** — Threshold methods are lossy compression. PoEM ranks outputs by absolute value, extracting maximum information from the state space and hitting the physical limit of finality.

**Market-Induced Hamiltonian** — The Hamiltonian is the price of the token. The market retroactively imposes an energy function on hash space, establishing a formal isomorphism between hash-market systems and thermodynamics.

**Information as Value** — Qi emission is strictly proportional to hash rate (Watts). Cumulative entropy reduction is a lossless proxy for work, making Qi a direct representation of free energy supplied to the system.
